# Abstract and optional shortened version.
#abstract = "We design an experiment to evaluate behavior in a dynamic spatial game representing the incentives faced by drivers for a ride-sharing service while waiting to be matched with a rider. The design is unique in that it allows us to observe not only participants' choices, but also the considerations that went into those choices. The results of the experiment show that a large majority of player choices are consistent with myopic best responding. A myopic best response maximizes a player's flow payoff at the time of the decision but is not necessarily optimal as it ignores strategic considerations regarding the future choices of opponents. Given the observed prevalence of this behavior and the challenges of equilibrium analysis, which we detail, we argue in favor of computational models of spatial competition built upon myopic agents. Myopic behavior in our model results in quite efficient outcomes, suggesting that ride-sharing companies may benefit from sharing with drivers the locations of other nearby drivers to allow them to compete spatially."
