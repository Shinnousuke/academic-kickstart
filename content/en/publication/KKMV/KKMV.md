abstract = "We study how the COVID-19 crisis could affect earnings inequality across heterogeneous
individuals in Japan. We use the Employment Status Survey (ESS) to
identify groups of individuals who are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 shocks,
which likely affect workers in different industries, occupations, and employment
types in different magnitude. We assess the impact using various data and early evidence
including consumption expenditures data from the JCB Consumption NOW
during the first weeks of the pandemic. Our study identifies significant heterogeneity
in vulnerability to the COVID-19 shocks across workers of different types. We
find that the crisis will hit low-income groups by more and is likely to significantly
exacerbate inequality through many channels that we could think of, calling for
urgent and large-scale assistance targeted towards affected individuals and for necessary
support towards affected industries in the medium term once the infection
risks are under control."
